Building is known to work in node 9.x and npm 5.x., probably other up-to-date versions as well.

Bundle and minify assets in the `dist` folder, create a zip file per browser:

```
# Clone repository, install npm and node, then:
npm install
npm run build
```

See `npm run` for a complete list of commands.
